# DataScienceJourney

## About
In this repository I want to record my experience I will get and try to explain what I learned throughout my journey.
This will be structured like a diary but only the days I am working on the topic of Data Science will be recorded
here. So I started the course 'Data Lit' on School of AI and this is my starting point of the journey.

## Why
I want to learn more about the techniques of Data Science like create datasets and analyze the data to strengthen my skills
and build a better understanding for Machine Learning models.
