# DataScienceJourney

## About
In this repository I want to record my experience I will get and try to 
explain what I learned throughout my journey. This will be structured like a 
diary but only the days I am working on the topic of Data Science will be 
recorded here. So I started the course 'Data Lit' on School of AI and this is 
my starting point of the journey.

## Why
I want to learn more about the techniques of Data Science like create datasets 
and analyze the data to strengthen my skills and build a better understanding 
for Machine Learning models.
